# Measure2Shape
We are introducing Measure2Shape, a novel footwear customization framework that tackles the limitations associated with relying on costly 3D scanners for capturing foot data, in which anthropometric measurements are used to estimate 3D foot shapes.  Importantly, our regression searching methods can be extended to other 3D body regions, offering customization solutions for diverse applications beyond footwear.
